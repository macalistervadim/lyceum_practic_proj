## Run the app üöÄ

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone {repository_url}`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dashboard`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Linux/macOS: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the main dependencies for production: `pip install -r requirements/prod.txt`
5. Set up your database: `python manage.py migrate`
6. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
7. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define your environment variables (see below for example variables)
8. Load environment variables in your Python code
9. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
10. Access the app at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser.
